**tqcher_panda_push_dense_100k.zip** - The TQC+HER trained policy from StableBaselines3. It was trained on 100 000 timesteps with the "time-feature" wrapper. Used config: `configs/tqcher_panda_push_dense.yaml`

**tqcher_fetch_reach_sparse_100k.zip** - The TQC+HER trained policy from StableBaselines3. It was trained on 100 000 timesteps with the "time-feature" wrapper. Used config: `configs/tqcher_fetch_reach_sparse.yaml`

**tqcher_panda_push_sparse_1m.zip** - The TQC+HER trained policy from StableBaselines3, downloaded from Huggingface. It was trained on 1 000 000 timesteps with the "time-feature" wrapper. It was converted from an old version of SB3 to the current one.

**tqcher_panda_pick_and_place_sparse_1m.zip** - The TQC+HER trained policy from StableBaselines3, downloaded from Huggingface. It was trained on 1 000 000 timesteps. It was converted from an old version of SB3 to the current one.
